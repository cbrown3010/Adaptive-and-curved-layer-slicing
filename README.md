# Adaptive-and-curved-layer-slicing
MATLAB Program to adaptive/curved slayer slicing for additive manufacturing.

Using the graphical user interface built on MATLAB the user can upload any STL or 3d model file to be sliced.
Uses two major methods, adaptive slicing using changing angles and residue height or bezier surfaces for curved layer slicing.
